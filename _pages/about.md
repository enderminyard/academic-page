I am interested in number theory, especially as it relates to post-quantum cryptography. 

I studied data science and machine learning at [Columbia University](https://columbia.edu) as part of an undergraduate research program. I became interested in [the connections between NP-hard problems in cryptography and open questions about hardness of learning](https://sitanchen.com/ccsi_rg.html) in computational learning theory. 

I am currently taking **Introduction to Number Theory I** and **Post-Quantum Cryptography** at [New York University](https://nyu.edu).  In the Fall 2025 semester, I studied number theory as a mentee in the [Twoples mentorship program](https://sites.google.com/view/twoples/home). Under the guidance of my [Twoples mentor](https://sites.google.com/view/twoples/home) Hunter Handley, I was able to solidify my understanding of the Hasse-Minkowski theorem by writing an expository paper.
